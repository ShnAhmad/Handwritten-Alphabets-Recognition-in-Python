# Alphabets-Recognition-in-Python
- This Python script demonstrates a simplified approach to alphabet recognition using logistic regression. 
- The code starts by creating a synthetic dataset of letters A, B, and C represented as 8x8 images.
- It then divides the data into training and testing sets. The core of the script is the train_model function, which employs gradient descent to train logistic regression weights for each class. After training, the recognize_alphabet function preprocesses an input image, predicts the corresponding letter using the learned weights, and displays the result. While this code provides a basic understanding of logistic regression for character recognition, it's important to note its limitations for complex scenarios. For more accurate results, advanced machine learning techniques and larger, real-world datasets would be advisable. Adapt and improve this code to suit your needs and contribute to the coding community.
